2020-05-22: With only 5 openssl commands, you can accomplish this.

Please do not change your browser security settings.

With the following code, you can (1) become your own CA, (2) then sign your SSL certificate as a CA. (3) Then import the CA certificate (not the SSL certificate, which goes onto your server) into Chrome/Chromium. (Yes, this works even on Linux.)

NB: For Windows, some reports say that openssl must be run with winpty to avoid a crash.

openssl genrsa -out $NAME.key 2048
# Create a certificate-signing request
openssl req -new -key $NAME.key -out $NAME.csr
# Create a config file for the extensions

DNS.1 = $NAME # Be sure to include the domain name here because Common Name is not so commonly honoured by itself
DNS.2 = bar.$NAME # Optionally, add additional domains (I've added a subdomain here)
IP.1 = 192.168.0.13 # Optionally, add an IP address (if the connection which you have planned requires it)
EOF
# Create the signed certificate
openssl x509 -req -in $NAME.csr -CA myCA.pem -CAkey myCA.key -CAcreateserial \
-out $NAME.crt -days 825 -sha256 -extfile $NAME.ext

To recap:

    Become a CA
    Sign your certificate using your CA cert+key
    Import myCA.pem as an "Authority" (not into "Your Certificates") in your Chrome settings (Settings > Manage certificates > Authorities > Import)
    Use the $NAME.crt and $NAME.key files in your server

Extra steps (for Mac, at least):

    Import the CA cert at "File > Import file", then also find it in the list, right click it, expand "> Trust", and select "Always"
    Add extendedKeyUsage=serverAuth,clientAuth below basicConstraints=CA:FALSE, and make sure you set the "CommonName" to the same as $NAME when it's asking for setup

You can check your work to ensure that the certificate is built correctly:

openssl verify -CAfile myCA.pem -verify_hostname bar.mydomain.com mydomain.com.crt

Method 2: Start certlm.msc (the certificates management console for local machine) and import the root CA certificate in the Registry physical store.
